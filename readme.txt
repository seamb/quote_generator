I built this application using a free quote API,  
making fetch calls to return an array of objects then 
mapping over to pull a random quote. 

Using the twitter API, I also have allowed for direct 
tweeting to your twitter feed. 

To style, I used CSS to set media queries so that the containers for the quotes
stay center and adjust font size depending on the size of the device screen. 
The overall esthetic is light and minimalistc to keep the focus on the 
quote text itsef.
